I immediately liked how it used types to define behavior.</p> <p>In 2022 and 2023 I carefully reviewed all the Python web frameworks. From my perspective FastAPI won out over Django, Flask, Pyramid, and others. I even gave a series of talks on the subject.</p> <p>In the middle of 2023, I was unhappy with how making web pages with FastAPI to support APIs felt clunky. It felt like a harder version of Flask. I talked to Sebastian Ramirez about it over the course of a week. I started thinking about making some kind of extension for FastAPI to make web pages easier, even wrote up a design document for it in December of 2023 titled \"FastHTML\".</p> <p>In early 2024 I noodled with the idea of a FastAPI for HTML, tentatively called \"FastHTML\". You can see one of my attempts here in a project called fastapi-blog. This particular project didn't go well, but allowed me to explore possible ideas for making a more friendly HTML API for developers. Alas, I was busy with work and family life and didn't have enough time to really focus on the project. I told Sebastian I was giving the effort a break.</p> <p>Shortly after Sebastian Ramirez introduced me to Jeremy Howard of Answer.AI. Jeremy demonstrated a Starlette-descendant project, called, amusingly enough, 'FastHTML'. Like FastAPI, his FastHTML implementation was driven directly by Starlette. He eschewed Jinja2 templating for HTML, instead implementing FT Components, an elegant version of Python classes that can render as HTML. While I like Jinja2, I also liked his implementation of Python objects rendered to HTML. Excited about a shared vision I started contributing to his FastHTML.</p> <p>In June of 2025 I started work on fastapi-tags, which is designed to bring fully typed Python classes that can render as HTML to FastAPI. After a couple weeks I realized I wanted to expand fastapi-tags to meet my original design document for building an HTML web page framework on top of FastAPI. The problem was that \"fastapi-tags\" didn't sound like a good framework name and \"FastHTML\" was already taken.</p> <p>Fortunately for me, my wife Audrey had a static site generator project called \"Air\". She volunteered the name for the web framework, and thus this project was born.</p>"},{"location":"api/","title":"Air Reference","text":"<p>Here is the Air reference documentation.

If you returned an object\n                that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does\n                not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have\n                that `password`.\n            * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the\n                `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the\n                corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not\n                valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,\n                so it's an error from the API developer.

If you returned an object\n                that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does\n                not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have\n                that `password`.\n            * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the\n                `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the\n                corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not\n                valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,\n                so it's an error from the API developer.

If you returned an object\n                that contains an attribute `password` but the `response_model` does\n                not include that field, the JSON sent to the client would not have\n                that `password`.\n            * Validation: whatever you return will be serialized with the\n                `response_model`, converting any data as necessary to generate the\n                corresponding JSON. But if the data in the object returned is not\n                valid, that would mean a violation of the contract with the client,\n                so it's an error from the API developer.

A Note from Audrey</p> <p>Vibe engineering1 is a new term coined by Simon Willison and currently being explored by me, Audrey M. Roy Greenfeld. It's like vibe coding, but with a focus on maintainability, code quality, clean architecture, and ability of AI agents to work with the codebase. In a way it's potentially the opposite of vibe coding because all you care about is having a great codebase, regardless of the end product.</p> <p>Here in this book our focus is on helping you set up your Air codebase to follow AI-assisted engineering best practices from the start, a field where we're all still working out what those best practices are. </p> <p>I'm still exploring whether to formally call it vibe engineering in this book, or something else. Terminology matters.

Specifically, you must also optimize your own codebase for AI collaboration. </p> <p>Follow these principles, which are extended from Air core:</p> <ul> <li>Every function should include comprehensive docstrings for AI understanding, because these help with AI context.</li> <li>Type hints should be extensive and precise for AI code completion, and used by AI to validate its code by running type checkers.</li> <li>Documentation should be written to be concise and clear for both humans and LLMs. Start with clear docstrings, then document anything that AI has trouble figuring out on its own. </li> <li>Aggressively remove comments that are blatantly obvious. AI often adds unnecessary comments to code, and it's your responsibility to fight that from the start. Only meaningful or truly helpful comments are allowed.</li> <li>Keep code flat. Reduce abstraction and functions calling functions calling functions to a bare minimum.</li> <li>Testing should be thoughtful and comprehensive, using pytest and coverage. AI agents can run pytest to check that they didn't break things, and add to tests. Write/curate the starting tests by hand, as AI will follow your patterns.</li> <li>Code structure follows predictable patterns that AI agents can easily navigate. Break up long files meaningfully so AI agents can selectively choose portions to read into context.</li> <li>Be strict about naming. Name everything carefully and precisely. Use AI to help you with naming. Make names self-documenting. No 1-2 letter variable or function names.</li> <li>Reduce cognitive load for both humans and AIs. Be expressive yet compact. Use bulleted cheatsheet-style lists and tables. Don't take \"smart\" coding shortcuts like <code>import *</code> or doubly-nested list comprehensions.</li> <li>Teach a human or AI how to fish. Teach them useful commands, so they can explore and extend them. Don't have them blindly follow recipes.</li> <li>Maximize observability. Use Playwright to provide screenshots to multimodal AI agents. Log liberally. Define and use custom exceptions.</li> </ul> <p>We'll now set up your project and development environment with the necessary tools to support these principles.</p>"},{"location":"book/03-ai-enhanced-development-setup/#linting-and-formatting-ruff","title":"Linting and Formatting: Ruff","text":"<p>Ruff is a fast Python linter and code formatter that helps maintain a clean and consistent codebase.
